# EditoriaLies

A Chrome extension for replacing specified words with chosen epithets.

EditoriaLies lets you alter the way a specific phrase appears on a website. The specified word or phrase will be replaced with another word or phrase of your choice. 

So if, for example, you're tired of seeing the name of a particular public figure in every other news story, you can craft a replacement name for this person. And this new name will appear in place of the person's actual name on any web page or article where the EditoriaLies extension can detect it.

Or you may find that the way a particular headline has been written isn't particularly accurate. So replace it with a better one.

Altered text is local and is only visible to you. And original text can be restored by clicking "Clear" button.

To use the extension, just click on the icon in your browser bar after you've pinned it. 

Words selected on the web page when the extension icon is clicked will be automatically copied to the "Find this text" box.

Please use your editing powers responsibly.
